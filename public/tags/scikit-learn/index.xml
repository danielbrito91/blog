      <description>Anthony Fantano (@theneedledrop, a.k.a Melon) has been reviewing albums on his YouTube channel for more than one decade. I have been enjoying his work and discovering some great music, at least since 2014.
Recently, I was wondering if I could fit a classification model to predict if the reviewed album would get a high score. Besides trying to predict if Fantano would love an album, I wanted to understand what features drive his scoring.</description>
